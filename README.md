# SimpleProcessing-Server

SimpleProcessing-Server
This project was created as a part of greater project and to learn by practice some technologies (Servlets, HTTP).

It let me:

- learn how to deploy simple web server (Heroku cloud platform),
- learn how to connect client (Android) with server and do some processing by HTTP requests and responses,
- push forward my project of Android game online.
